## Setup & Installation

> These instructions assume you have Node.js installed, plus any needed database (if applicable).

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adarsh234/IBlog.git
   cd IBlog
   ````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the backend (and frontend if needed) folder with the required variables:

   ```
   PORT=5000
   DB_URL=<your-database-connection-string>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
   ```

   (Add any other environment variables your app requires.)

4. **Run the application**

   In one terminal:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

   In another terminal:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

   By default, the frontend might run on `localhost:3000` and backend on `localhost:5000` (or whatever you have configured).

---

## Configuration

* **Database**: Make sure your database is running and accessible with credentials you provided in `.env`.
* **JWT or Authentication**: Set up secrets.
* **CORS / Proxy settings**: If your frontend and backend are on different hosts or ports, configure CORS or proxy appropriately.

---

## Usage

* Open the frontend in the browser (`http://localhost:3000` or configured address)
* Use the UI to create blog posts
* Register / Login (if part of the app)
* Read, edit, delete posts
* Explore how data flows between frontend and backend
